## About

Greetings! I am the Rev. Dr. Stephanie M. Wyatt, an ordained Baptist minister with a Ph.D. in Biblical Interpretation. I find vocational fulfillment through congregational ministry and teaching biblical studies to students preparing for ministerial careers. In this way I seek to keep one foot in the church and one in the academy in ways that benefit both spheres. In my free time I enjoy paper crafting, outdoor music concerts, arts & crafts fairs, learning about art and architecture, visiting museums, traveling, thrift shopping, and playing with my niece and nephew. Personally, I am engaging, empathetic, approachable, cooperative, flexible, pragmatic, and thoughtful with a fun-loving spirit.
